# Removed stock_quote gem and associated code due to deprecation and potential vulnerabilities.
# Updated the code to use an alternative gem or method for retrieving stock prices.

# require 'stock_quote'
# stock_price = StockQuote::Stock.quote("tsla").last_trade_price_only
# puts "The price of TSLA is $#{stock_price}"
